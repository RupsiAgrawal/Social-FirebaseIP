FCM :Firebase Cloud Messaging 
Google moved from Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) to Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM). Just like GCM, FCM is a cross-platform messaging solution that allows you to send messages. FCM is completely free and there are no limitations
, I strongly recommend you migrate to Firebase today itself. In the code we learn the features of firebase cloud messaging by building a simple app. We’ll also learn how to integrate firebase to your android application.


Splash Screen:

Android splash screen are normally used to show user some kind of progress before the app loads completely. Some people uses splash screen just to show case their app / company logo for a couple of second. Unfortunately in android we don’t have any inbuilt mechanism to show splash screen compared to iOS.
 so I am writing a code how to implement splash screen in your android application.


Into Slides: 

Adding Welcome / Intro screens in your app is a great way of showcasing the major features of the app. Previously I explained about adding a static Splash Screen to your app. now we are going to add an intro slider to your app where user can swipe through few slides before getting into app.
To demonstrate, I am creating a simple app that contains few intro slides with next and skip navigation. The user can navigate through each slide using swipe gesture or using the next button.

Social Media Integration:

Gmail, Facebook, LinkedIn sign-in lets users sign in to your Android app with their existing social media account and get their profile information like name, email, profile pic and other details. By integrating social media login in your apps, you can get all the user details in one shot. Not only login, you can do other things like posting to their social accounts, getting list of circles, friends list and lot more. The major advantage of integrating social login is, you can drive more users to your app by providing quicker & easiest way of registration process.

Google+ sign-in lets users sign in to your Android app with their existing Google account and get their profile information like name, email, profile pic and other details. By integrating google plus login in your apps, you can get all the user details in one shot. Not only login, you can do other things like posting to their g+ account,
getting list of circles, friends list and lot more. The major advantage of integrating G+ login is, you can drive more users to your app by providing quicker & easiest way of registration process.

requires google-services.json file to be placed in project?s app folder. Follow the below steps to get your google-services.json file.

 Java keytool can be used to generate SHA-1 fingerprint. Open your terminal and execute the following command to generate SHA-1 fingerprint. If it ask for password, type android and press enter.
 Create project in google console and enter your package name here and SHA-1 fingerprint.after download google-services.json file and copy paste in to your application folder.
